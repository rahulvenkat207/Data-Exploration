object localization
Letâ€™s now focus on the ILSVRC2012 dataset. Find the link in the imagenet website.
Understand the annotation data for each image. You should find classification as well as bounding box information
Pick 3 categories. Plot the annotations including the bounding box on randomly selected 10 images from each category.
Given that a model is producing label + localization (i.e bounding box) information, how will you compare it against the ground truth. Matching labels is straightforward. But when the model is also giving a bounding box output, how is the quality of the bounding box evaluated? Hint : Find the bounding box overlap percentage. Write a python function which takes two bounding boxes as input and outputs the overlap percentage.
