Let’s focus on ILSVRC2010 dataset for this 
Click the “Browse the training images ..” link under the “Data” section. 
Each of you picks 3 categories from the list above.
You download 100 images from each category picked.
Look at the image and the corresponding annotation. Understand what the annotation describes.
You should be able to randomly pick 10 images and display them in a jupyter notebook.

I have chosen 3 classes:
n04254680: soccer ball
n04118538 : rugby ball
n04540053: volley ball 
I have downloaded these datasets from ImageNet. Each category contains almost 1500 images .
I have randomly selected 10 images from these 3 classes and represented it with their class name
